Some set-up is required to run this program. Hopefully I can list everything 
needed from memory.
1. Install Pydora and required dependancies
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo apt-get install python-dev
	sudo pip install cryptography
	sudo pip install pydora
2. Place the provided .pydora.cfg file in ~/.pydora.cfg
3. Edit config file with personal info. Use apps.twitter.com to get personal keys.
4. To run on start, place the following lines at the end of home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
	@usr/bin/python /(location of twitter_gui.py)
5. Due to internet connectivity problems with twitter's api, it is good practice to
have your device restart every day. To do this, add the following line to crontab -e
	0 5 * * * sudo reboot
6. To exit fullscreen, hit escape on your keyboard.
7. There seems to be problems connecting to Twitter after a hard-boot. Grab a keyboard
and sudo reboot to fix this.
8. If running from somwhere that is not the desktop, make sure to change the 
file directories in the code. I am not good enough at python to know how to
set these automatically. If you do, feel free to change them.


This is a trash peice of software with so many flaws, but it was fun to build 
and I learned a lot. For any questions, comments, and concerns, contact
